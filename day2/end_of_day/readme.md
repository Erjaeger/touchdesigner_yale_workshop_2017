## Day 2 - End of Day Files ##
_1.5.17_

As much as I'm going to try and ensure that our end of day file looks exactly as planned, there are bound to be differences from what I've set out to teach you as compaired to what we do. For that very reason we have a directory dedicated to all of our examples that we make through the day. This way you can pull up exactly what you saw me do in the workshop.
